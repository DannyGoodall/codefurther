    """A wrapper for the gmaps Direction class to make it simpler to deal with in the classroom

    The :py:class:`GetDirections` class is inititialised with a starting point, an end_point and
    and optional transport mode.

    >>> directions = GetDirections("southampton, UK","winchester, UK", mode="walking")

    This returns an object that can then be interrogated for information about the route.

    >>> if directions.found:
    >>>     print("Directions found!")
    >>> else:
    >>>     print("Couldn't find a route.")

    If a valid route was found, simplified and prettified text can be accessed through:

    >>> directions.heading
    >>> "These are the steps for the (walking) journey from Southampton, Southampton, UK to Winchester, Winchester, Hampshire, UK."

    and:

    >>> directions.footer
    >>> "Map data Â©2014 Google"

    and the steps of the route can be accessed through the :py:attr:`GetDirections.steps` property, which returns
    a :py:class:`list` of :py:class:`str`.

    >>> directions.steps
    >>> [
    >>>     "1. Head east (8 m / 1 min)",
    >>>     "2. Turn left toward Brunswick Pl/A3024 (7 m / 1 min)",
    >>>     "3. Turn right toward Brunswick Pl/A3024 (0.2 km / 3 mins)",
    >>>     "4. Turn right onto Brunswick Pl/A3024 (13 m / 1 min)",

    >>>     .
    >>>     .
    >>>     "39. Turn right onto Colebrook St (85 m / 1 min)"
    >>> ]

    The raw :py:class:`gmaps.Directions` object can be accessed using:

    >>> directions.raw

    Once the object has been created, subsequent calls to the :py:meth:`GetDirections.journey` method will create
    new routes without the need to create a brand new :py:meth:`GetDirections` object.
